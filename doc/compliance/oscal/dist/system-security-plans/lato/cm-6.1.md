# cm-6.1 - \[\] Automated Management, Application, and Verification

## Control Statement

Manage, apply, and verify configuration settings for all operating systems using automated mechanisms as documented in the SSPP/CM Plan.

## Control guidance

Automated tools (e.g., hardening tools, baseline configuration tools) can improve the accuracy, consistency, and availability of configuration settings information. Automation can also provide data aggregation and data correlation capabilities, alerting mechanisms, and dashboards to support risk-based decision-making within the organization.

## Control assessment-objective

configuration settings for all operating systems are managed using automated mechanisms;
configuration settings for all operating systems are applied using automated mechanisms;
configuration settings for all operating systems are verified using automated mechanisms.
