# cm-3.1 - \[\] Automated Documentation, Notification, and Prohibition of Changes

## Control Statement

Use automated mechanisms as identified in the SSPP/CM Plan to:

- \[(a)\] Document proposed changes to the system;

- \[(b)\] Notify GSA S/SO or Contractor recommended approval authorities approved by the GSA CISO and AO of proposed changes to the system and request change approval;

- \[(c)\] Highlight proposed changes to the system that have not been approved or disapproved within Administrators (Application, System, Network, etc.), Information System Security Officer, Information System Security Manager, System Owner (e.g., System Program Manager, System Project Manager);

- \[(d)\] Prohibit changes to the system until designated approvals are received;

- \[(e)\] Document all changes to the system; and

- \[(f)\] Notify personnel when approved changes to the system are completed.

## Control guidance

None.
