# cm-8.2 - \[\] Automated Maintenance

## Control Statement

Maintain the currency, completeness, accuracy, and availability of the inventory of system components using automated mechanisms as documented in the SSPP/CM Plan.

## Control guidance

Organizations maintain system inventories to the extent feasible. For example, virtual machines can be difficult to monitor because such machines are not visible to the network when not in use. In such cases, organizations maintain as up-to-date, complete, and accurate an inventory as is deemed reasonable. Automated maintenance can be achieved by the implementation of [CM-2(2)](#cm-2.2) for organizations that combine system component inventory and baseline configuration activities.

## Control assessment-objective

automated mechanisms are used to maintain the currency of the system component inventory;
automated mechanisms are used to maintain the completeness of the system component inventory;
automated mechanisms are used to maintain the accuracy of the system component inventory;
automated mechanisms are used to maintain the availability of the system component inventory.
